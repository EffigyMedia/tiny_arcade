/* =====================================================================
   TINY ARCADE — sw.js

   Two jobs, and they pull in opposite directions:

     · never serve a stale file when the network is there
     · always serve something when it is not

   So pages and scripts are network-first with a short timeout and a cache
   fallback, while art and fonts are served from cache immediately and
   refreshed in the background. There is no version number to maintain —
   freshness comes from asking the network first, not from a cache name.

   Games are cached the first time you open them, so a machine you have
   never played is the one thing that will not work on a plane.
