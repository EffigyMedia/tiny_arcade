   ROAD — the shared driving engine

   Highway and Raceway were 96.5% identical: 9,100 lines the same, 332
   different. Every fix had to be applied twice by hand, and the two were
   already drifting — ROADSTER and per-car grip existed in one and not the
   other.

   This is that shared 96.5%, as one factory. A game calls `ROAD(CFG)` and
   supplies only what makes it different. The engine asks CFG at four seams
   and behaves normally when they are absent, so Highway passes almost nothing.

   THE SEAMS
     CFG.id          save namespace     'highway' | 'raceway'
     CFG.title       the <h1>

     CFG.grade       (z, fallback) => g
     CFG.hudScore    (dist) => string          "4.6 MI" or "LAP 1/5"

     CFG.onStep      (dt)                      lap counting

   Everything else — the road, the cars, the physics, the audio, the garage —
   lives here once.

   A pseudo-3D road curves by displacing each segment sideways as it recedes.
   The classic way is to accumulate the offset while drawing, but `proj()` is
   called from everywhere — sprites, skids, the mirror — so it needs a value
   any z can be asked for.

   `bendAt(z)` is the lateral displacement of the road CENTRELINE at z, built by
   integrating curvature twice and cached at 400-unit resolution. Everything
   that lives on the road — you, traffic, rivals, cruisers, lamp posts — keeps
   its lane position and gets the bend added in projection, so nothing needs to
   know the road is turning. It just is.

/* ---- the two cornering dials ---------------------------------------------
   CORNER_G  how hard a bend throws you, everything else being equal. The only
             arbitrary number in the model — raise it if corners feel like
             scenery, lower it if they feel like ice.
   CORNER_LAG how quickly the load builds and bleeds as you enter and leave a
             bend. Higher is snappier, lower is more languid.
   The force itself is curvature x speed^2, which is real: a corner taken flat
   at 90 pulls a quarter of what it does at 180.
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
/* ---- GRIP IS A PER-CAR STAT NOW ----------------------------------------
   On a straight road this was a global feel dial, because a corner you can
   take flat is a corner nobody has to think about. On a circuit it is the
   third axis — top speed, acceleration, and how hard you can lean on a bend.

   `CORNER_G` is the force a bend exerts on YOU, so a HIGHER number is a car
   that gets pushed wide more easily. Grip is therefore its inverse: a grippy
   car has a low `CORNER_G`.

   EVERY car carries the stat now. It was set on the three sports cars only,
   and the other eleven silently defaulted to 1.0 — which meant a formula car
   and a lorry cornered identically, and the only reason nobody noticed is that
   Highway has no corners worth the name.

   BILLBOARD ANGLES

   A car ahead of you in a corner is not showing you its back — it is showing
   you its flank, and by how much depends on how far the road has turned
   between your position and theirs.

   That number is already cached. `slopeCache` holds the heading at every z, so
   the relative angle is a subtraction:

       yaw = slope(theirZ) - slope(myZ)

   Pick a sprite from it, the way every arcade racer since Pole Position has:
   rear when they are pointing away, three-quarter as they turn in, full
   profile through the apex. The road cannot bend past 90 degrees on screen,
   but the CARS can look right the whole way, and the same system is what a
   kart racer needs to show a rival mid-drift.
   =========================================================================== */
/* ---- THE SIDE VIEW ------------------------------------------------------
   A car from the flank is a different drawing, not a squashed rear: a long
   low body, a cabin set back, two wheels under the arches, and the lights at
   the ends rather than across the tail.

   `squash` is how much of the length is foreshortened — 1.0 is dead side-on,
   0.45 is the three-quarter view. One painter serves both, because a
   three-quarter IS a profile seen at an angle plus a sliver of the back.
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
/* ---- NOT BUILT, AND KEPT ON PURPOSE -------------------------------------
   `paintProfile` and `paintQuarter` are no longer generated: on a circuit
   every car faces the way you do, so a rear sprite is the only view needed.
   They are kept because a KART RACER does need them — a rival mid-drift is
   side-on to you by definition, and that game is on the planned list.

         visible stripe off at 146. Twenty-one pixels were COVERED, not
         missing — which is why widening the numbers changed nothing.

         The maths was right and the order was wrong. It goes after the lamps
         and the badge now, the way the muscle car's already did.
         The body runs from `bodyTop` down to `cy - h*0.035`, but the stripe
         stopped at `cy - h*0.08` — short by 0.045h, which is a visible band of
         bare paint under it. On STALLION and MATADOR that gap is what made the
         stripes look like they had ridden up the car.

         Both runs measure off the SAME numbers the body uses now, so they
         cannot drift again: roof from `cabinTop` to `bodyTop`, deck from
         `bodyTop` to the bottom of the body.

         cabin BOX starts well above the metal because the roof is a curve
         inset from it — so every constant I tried (`cabinTop`, then
         `cabinTop + 0.015`) put the stripe in the air above the car.

         Rather than guess a third offset, the roof line is read off the shape
         the greenhouse actually draws: the cabin spans `cabinTop` to
         `bodyTop`, and the metal begins about a quarter of the way down that

   WEATHER

   Shared, because rain is not a circuit idea — a wet highway is as good a
   reason to lift as a wet corner. One number, `wet`, from 0 to 1, and
   everything reads it:

     grip      falls to 62% of dry, so `cornerG` rises and the car runs wide
     braking   falls to 68%, which is what actually catches people out
     spray     the car ahead throws a plume; the slipstream still works but
               you cannot see through it
     light     the sky darkens and the road turns reflective

   It builds and clears over minutes rather than switching, so a run has
   weather rather than a weather SETTING.

     not reach the horizon, so that near-colour showed in the gap.
