# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THIS LIST IS WHY EVERY CABINET 404ED ON GITHUB PAGES. It predated the
# games/<cat>/ folders, the road.js split and assets.js — so a push shipped a
# launcher whose catalogue pointed at eighteen files that were never copied,
# and `cp games/*.html` matched nothing with its failure eaten by `|| true`.
# The launcher loaded, every machine on it was a dead link, and it looked
# like a hosting problem rather than a deploy that had quietly shipped half
# the app.
#
# The list below matches what pack.sh whitelists and what sw.js caches. If a
# file is added to one, it goes in all three. games/ and fonts/ are mirrored
# exactly (deletions included) because the build owns those two directories
# outright; nothing outside them is ever deleted from the repo.
